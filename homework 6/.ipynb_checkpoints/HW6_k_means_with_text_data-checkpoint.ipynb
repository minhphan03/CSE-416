    "## Important Gradescope Submission Guidelines:\n",
    "-\tFor this assignment, due to some time-consuming demonstrations in the notebook, please copy paste your solutions to the marked `TODO` to the `cse416_hw6.py` file. Do not rename it and you should submit the `cse416_hw6.py` file with just code to the corresponding `TODO`.\n",
    "-   Do not include any print() lines in your submission file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fill in the cells provided marked `TODO` with code to answer the questions. **Unless otherwise noted, every answer you submit should have code that clearly computes the answers.** Answers submitted that do not have associated code that shows the answer may not be accepted for credit. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will implement the k-means algorithm in the specific setting of clustering text documents, but the algorithm is general to any setting. When properly executed, clustering uncovers valuable insights from a set of unlabeled documents. The assignment uses the `numpy` library for manipulating the data arrays. See [this tutorial](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/quickstart.html) for more information on numpy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will practice:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cluster Wikipedia documents using k-means\n",
    "* Explore the role of random initialization on the quality of the clustering\n",
    "* Explore how results differ after changing the number of clusters\n",
    "* Evaluate clustering, both quantitatively and qualitatively\n",
